# Cascadeâš¡ð“‚§Ï†âˆž Application Examples

This directory contains practical application examples for the Cascade Symbiotic Computing Platform, demonstrating how to use CascadeOS in various contexts.

## Applications Overview

### 1. Meditation Enhancer
**File:** `meditation_enhancer.py`

A meditation enhancement application that creates a bidirectional phi-harmonic field that responds to the meditator's state. It includes:
- Simulated biofeedback that could be replaced with actual sensors
- Breath pacing visualization based on phi-harmonic rhythms
- Meditation guidance based on coherence levels
- Session tracking with coherence history
- Visualization of session results

**Usage:**
```bash
python meditation_enhancer.py --user "Your Name" --duration 10 --guidance medium
```

### 2. Creative Flow Enhancer
**File:** `creative_flow_enhancer.py`

An application for enhancing creative flow states for artistic or problem-solving work. It includes:
- Pattern generation based on quantum field dynamics
- Creative prompt synthesis
- Flow state tracking
- Domain-specific settings for different creative disciplines
- Visualization of creative patterns

**Usage:**
```bash
python creative_flow_enhancer.py --domain visual_art --duration 15 --interval 5
```

### 3. Team Collaboration Field
**File:** `team_collaboration_field.py`

A team modeling and optimization tool that uses the Teams of Teams architecture to enhance collaboration. It includes:
- Team member trait profiling
- Interaction simulation between team members
- Collaboration metrics and visualization
- Team recommendations based on quantum field patterns
- Optimal team combinations identification

**Usage:**
```bash
python team_collaboration_field.py --team "Project Team" --interactions 30 --structured
```

### 4. Hardware Integration
**File:** `hardware_integration.py`

An example of integrating CascadeOS with hardware sensors for real biofeedback. It supports:
- Arduino-based heart rate/GSR sensors
- Webcam-based heart rate detection
- Microphone-based breathing detection
- Muse EEG headband integration
- Graceful fallback to simulation when hardware isn't available

**Usage:**
```bash
python hardware_integration.py --mode auto --duration 5 --interval 10
```

### 5. Web Interface
**File:** `web_interface.py`

A web-based interface to interact with CascadeOS from any device with a browser. It includes:
- Real-time visualization of quantum fields
- Interactive controls for consciousness states
- Session management and history
- User profiles
- Socket.IO for real-time communication

**Usage:**
```bash
python web_interface.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```
Then open a web browser to `http://localhost:5000`

## Requirements

These examples require additional dependencies beyond the base CascadeOS:

```bash
# Basic visualization
pip install matplotlib

# Hardware integration
pip install pyserial opencv-python dlib pyaudio scipy

# EEG integration
pip install muselsl

# Web interface
pip install flask flask-socketio
```

## Common Parameters

Most examples support these parameters:
- `--dimensions`: Field dimensions (default varies by application)
- `--duration`: Session duration in minutes
- `--frequency`: Initial sacred frequency name to use (e.g., "unity", "love")

## Building Your Own Applications

These examples demonstrate different approaches to using CascadeOS:

1. **Direct field manipulation**: Working directly with quantum fields
2. **Consciousness interface**: Using the bidirectional interface
3. **Teams of Teams**: Leveraging specialized processing teams
4. **Hardware integration**: Connecting to physical sensors
5. **Web access**: Creating network-accessible interfaces

You can combine these approaches to create your own applications tailored to specific use cases.

## Phi-Harmonic Integration

All examples demonstrate phi-harmonic integration by:
- Using Fibonacci-based field dimensions (21, 34, 55, 89...)
- Applying sacred frequencies (432Hz, 528Hz, etc.)
- Incorporating phi-based timing and rhythms
- Using phi-weighted averages for calculations
- Creating phi-resonant visualization patterns
