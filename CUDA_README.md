# CUDA Integration for Quantum Field Visualization

This document explains how to use CUDA acceleration with the quantum field visualization tools.

## Overview

The quantum field visualization tools can leverage NVIDIA GPUs through CUDA to significantly accelerate field generation and analysis. This implementation uses the official NVIDIA CUDA Python package for low-level GPU access with automatic CPU fallback when CUDA is unavailable.

## Requirements

- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA capability
- CUDA Toolkit 11.8 or newer
- Python 3.8 or newer
- Required Python packages:
  - `cuda-python` - Low-level CUDA bindings
  - `numpy` - Array manipulation
  - `cupy` - GPU-accelerated array operations (optional, for advanced functionality)

## Installation

1. Install the CUDA Toolkit from [NVIDIA's website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy cuda-python
pip install cupy  # Optional, for advanced functionality
```

## Architecture

The CUDA integration follows a layered approach:

1. **Core Layer**: Low-level CUDA bindings via `cuda.core.experimental` for direct kernel execution
2. **Algorithm Layer**: CUDA-accelerated implementations of quantum field algorithms
3. **Universal Processor**: High-level abstraction that selects the optimal implementation

## Features

- **Automatic Fallback**: Gracefully falls back to CPU implementation when CUDA is unavailable
- **Thread Block Optimization**: Efficient thread block configuration for 2D and 3D calculations
- **Stream-based Execution**: Asynchronous kernel execution for improved performance
- **Thread Block Clustering**: Support for H100 GPUs with thread block cluster extensions
- **Sacred Geometry Recognition**: GPU-accelerated pattern detection algorithms
- **Phi-Harmonic Pattern Visualization**: GPU-optimized rendering of phi-based patterns

## Quantum Field Generation

The CUDA-accelerated quantum field generation provides:

- Up to 100x speedup for large fields (performance varies by GPU)
- Consistent results with CPU implementation for coherence calculation
- Support for all sacred frequencies and phi-based constants

## Phi-Harmonic Acceleration

The phi-harmonic calculations benefit from parallel computation:

- Efficient calculation of resonance patterns
- Fast coherence metrics computation
- Accelerated sacred geometry detection

## Advanced Usage

For advanced GPU usage:

1. **Thread Block Clusters**: For H100+ GPUs, the library supports thread block clusters
2. **Multiple Streams**: Concurrent kernel execution with multiple CUDA streams
3. **Memory Management**: Explicit control over GPU memory allocation/deallocation
4. **DLPack Interoperability**: Support for NumPy/CuPy array interchange

## Examples

See example usage in the following files:
- `quantum_cuda.py` - Basic CUDA integration
- `quantum_acceleration.py` - Performance benchmarking
- `quantum_universal_processor.py` - High-level API with CUDA support

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:

- **CUDA not found**: Ensure CUDA Toolkit is properly installed and environment variables set
- **Invalid device ordinal**: Check that your GPU is detected with `nvidia-smi`
- **Out of memory**: Reduce field dimensions or batch size
- **Kernel launch failure**: Update GPU drivers to latest version

## Performance Tips

- Use larger field sizes to maximize GPU utilization
- Process multiple fields concurrently with separate streams
- Prefer batch operations over individual calls
- Use the Universal Processor's built-in optimizations
