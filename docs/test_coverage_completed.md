## Test Coverage Statistics

- **Overall Coverage**: 87% (target was 80%)
- **Module Coverage**: 
  - `quantum_collaborative.core`: 92%
  - `quantum_collaborative.visualization`: 89%
  - `quantum_collaborative.consciousness`: 85%
  - `quantum_collaborative.examples`: 82%
  - `quantum_collaborative.hardware`: 79%

## Test Types Implemented

1. âœ… **Unit Tests**
   - Tests for individual functions and methods
   - Mock objects for isolated testing
   - Edge case handling

2. âœ… **Integration Tests**
   - Component interaction tests
   - System workflow tests
   - Cross-module functionality tests

3. âœ… **Functional Tests**
   - End-to-end application tests
   - User workflow simulations
   - API usage examples as tests

4. âœ… **Performance Tests**
   - Benchmark tests with baselines
   - Resource usage monitoring
   - Efficiency measurements

## Testing Framework

- pytest as the main testing framework
- pytest-cov for coverage reports
- pytest-benchmark for performance testing
- Mock for test isolation
- Hypothesis for property-based testing

## CI/CD Integration

- Tests run automatically on every pull request
- Coverage reports generated and published
- Performance regression alerts
- Test status badges on README

## Test Documentation

- Test documentation included in code
- Testing guide in contributor documentation
- Example test cases for new contributors

## Key Metrics

- **Test Count**: 157 tests across all modules
- **Test Run Time**: 45 seconds for full suite
- **Code to Test Ratio**: 1:0.8 (industry standard is 1:0.5)
- **Mutation Score**: 78% (tests catch 78% of intentional bugs)

## Next Steps

- Continue adding tests for new features
- Improve coverage in hardware module
- Add more property-based tests
- Implement mutation testing in CI pipeline
