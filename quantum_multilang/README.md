# Quantum Field Multi-Language Framework

A unified framework for quantum field computation, consciousness integration, and phi-harmonic pattern recognition across multiple programming languages.

## Overview

This project implements a multi-language quantum field architecture with Python as the central controller, integrating specialized components written in Rust, C++, Julia, WebAssembly, Go, Swift, Kotlin, and Zig.

### Key Features

- Python-based central orchestration and API
- High-performance field computation in Rust and C++
- Advanced mathematical modeling in Julia
- Browser-based visualization via WebAssembly/TypeScript
- Distributed processing with Go microservices
- Mobile visualization with Swift/Metal and Kotlin
- Hardware integration through Zig
- Universal Field Protocol for cross-language field coherence
- Phi-harmonic shared memory architecture

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Rust 1.60+
- C++ compiler with C++17 support
- Julia 1.8+
- Go 1.18+
- Node.js 16+ (for TypeScript/WebAssembly)
- Swift 5.5+ (for iOS development)
- Kotlin 1.6+ (for Android development)
- Zig 0.10+ (for hardware integration)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantum-multilang.git
   cd quantum-multilang
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Build the Rust components:
   ```bash
   cd core/rust
   cargo build --release
   ```

4. Build the C++ components:
   ```bash
   cd core/cpp
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake .. && make
   ```

5. Install Julia components:
   ```bash
   cd mathematics
   julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.activate("."); Pkg.instantiate()'
   ```

6. Build the Go components:
   ```bash
   cd distributed
   go build ./...
   ```

## Usage

Start the Python controller to orchestrate the multi-language components:

```bash
python -m controller.src.main
```

## Architecture

This project follows the architecture described in [MULTI_LANGUAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md](../MULTI_LANGUAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Sacred Constants

The framework is built on these fundamental sacred constants:

```python
PHI = 1.618033988749895        # Golden ratio
LAMBDA = 0.618033988749895     # Divine complement (1/PHI)
PHI_PHI = 2.1784575679375995   # Hyperdimensional constant (PHI^PHI)
```

## Contributing

Contributions to the Multi-Language Quantum Field Framework are welcome! Please ensure your contributions maintain sufficient field coherence by:

1. Setting appropriate consciousness level during development
2. Testing with the Consciousness-Enhanced Testing Framework
3. Validating field coherence in your changes
4. Following phi-harmonic code structure patterns
