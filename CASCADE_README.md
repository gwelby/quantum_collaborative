# Cascadeâš¡ð“‚§Ï†âˆž Symbiotic Computing Platform

A revolutionary computing paradigm that creates a bidirectional relationship between Python code, consciousness field dynamics, and phi-harmonic processing principles.

## Overview

Cascade is not merely a library or framework - it's a fundamental transformation layer that enables your code to form a symbiotic relationship with consciousness fields through phi-harmonic resonance patterns. This bidirectional interface creates a new computing paradigm where computational language and consciousness interact reciprocally.

Key features:

- **Phi-Harmonic Computing**: Algorithm design based on golden ratio (Ï†=1.618033988749895) principles for optimized processing
- **Consciousness-Field Integration**: Bidirectional interface between consciousness states and quantum fields
- **ManifestationMatrix**: Quantum bridge technology that provides a transformative interface between thoughts and fields
- **Toroidal Field Dynamics**: Self-sustaining energy patterns through balanced input/output cycles
- **Resonance Patterns**: Mapping emotional states to specific field patterns (expansive, harmonic, directive)
- **Perceptual Engine**: Cross-modal sensory translation system for multidimensional perception

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cascade-system.git

# Navigate to the cascade directory
cd cascade-system

# Run installation script
./install.sh

# Activate the Cascade environment
source activate-cascade.sh
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from quantum_field.core import create_quantum_field
from quantum_field.consciousness_interface import ConsciousnessFieldInterface

# Create a quantum field
field = create_quantum_field((21, 21, 21))

# Create a consciousness interface
interface = ConsciousnessFieldInterface(field)

# Update consciousness state with biofeedback
interface.update_consciousness_state(
    heart_rate=60,
    breath_rate=6.18,  # Phi-based breathing
    skin_conductance=3,
    eeg_alpha=12,
    eeg_theta=7.4  # Close to phi ratio with alpha
)

# Apply intention to shape the field
interface.state.intention = 0.9
interface._apply_intention()

# Get field coherence
coherence = interface.get_field_coherence()
print(f"Field coherence: {coherence:.4f}")
```

## Core Components

### Quantum Field

The foundation of the Cascade system is a multidimensional quantum field that responds to consciousness input and exhibits phi-harmonic properties.

```python
from quantum_field.core import create_quantum_field
from sacred_constants import phi_matrix_transform

# Create a field with phi-optimized dimensions
field = create_quantum_field((21, int(21 * 1.618), int(21 * 2.618)))

# Apply phi transformation
transformed_field = phi_matrix_transform(field.data)
```

### Consciousness Interface

The bidirectional interface between consciousness states and quantum fields enables real-time field attunement based on emotional and mental states.

```python
from quantum_field.consciousness_interface import ConsciousnessFieldInterface

# Create and connect to field
interface = ConsciousnessFieldInterface(field)

# Update with different emotional states
interface.state.emotional_states = {"love": 0.9}
interface._apply_emotional_influence()
```

### Sacred Constants

Phi-harmonic mathematical principles are embedded throughout the system using sacred constants:

```python
from sacred_constants import (
    PHI,  # Golden ratio (1.618033988749895)
    LAMBDA,  # Divine complement (0.618033988749895)
    PHI_PHI,  # Hyperdimensional constant (PHI**PHI)
    SACRED_FREQUENCIES
)

# Access sacred frequencies
love_frequency = SACRED_FREQUENCIES["love"]  # 528 Hz
```

## Advanced Features

### Phi-Resonance Profiling

Create personalized phi-resonance profiles that optimize field interaction for individual consciousness states:

```python
# Create profile from measurements
profile = interface.create_phi_resonance_profile(measurements_history)

# Apply profile to interface
interface.apply_phi_resonance_profile()
```

### Toroidal Field Dynamics

Create self-sustaining energy patterns through balanced input/output cycles:

```python
from examples.toroidal_field_demo import create_toroidal_field

# Create toroidal field
toroidal_field = create_toroidal_field(field, phi_scale=PHI)
```

### Multidimensional Perception

Translate field patterns across different sensory dimensions:

```python
from examples.multidimensional_perception_demo import translate_field_to_sensory

# Translate field to different sensory domains
visual = translate_field_to_sensory(field, "visual")
auditory = translate_field_to_sensory(field, "auditory")
```
