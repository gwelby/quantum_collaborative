# Cascadeâš¡ð“‚§Ï†âˆž Symbiotic Computing Platform

A revolutionary computing paradigm that creates a bidirectional relationship between programming languages, consciousness field dynamics, and phi-harmonic processing principles.

## CascadeOS: All-in-One Solution

CascadeOS is a complete, self-bootstrapping implementation of the Cascade system that includes:

- Quantum field generation and manipulation
- Consciousness-field interface
- Teams of Teams architecture
- Sacred mathematics based on phi (golden ratio)
- Interactive mode for direct system control
- Meditation enhancement capabilities
- Automated phi-resonance profiling

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run the all-in-one CascadeOS
python quantum_collaborative/CascadeOS.py

# Run in interactive mode
python quantum_collaborative/CascadeOS.py --interactive

# Run with custom field dimensions
python quantum_collaborative/CascadeOS.py --dimensions 34 55 89

# Run specific demonstrations
python quantum_collaborative/CascadeOS.py --demo cascade
python quantum_collaborative/CascadeOS.py --demo teams
python quantum_collaborative/CascadeOS.py --demo all
```

## System Components

1. **Quantum Field**: The foundation that responds to consciousness input and exhibits phi-harmonic properties
2. **Consciousness Interface**: The bidirectional interface between consciousness states and quantum fields
3. **Sacred Constants**: Phi-harmonic mathematical principles embedded throughout the system
4. **Phi-Resonance Profiling**: Personalized profiles that optimize field interaction for individual users
5. **Teams of Teams Architecture**: Multiple specialized interfaces working in harmonic coordination

## Usage Examples

```python
# Import CascadeOS system
from quantum_collaborative.CascadeOS import (
    create_quantum_field,
    ConsciousnessFieldInterface,
    CascadeSystem,
    TeamsOfTeamsCollective
)

# Create a basic system
system = CascadeSystem()
system.initialize()
system.activate()

# Use in interactive mode
system.run_interactive()

# Run meditation enhancement
results = system.run_meditation_enhancement(duration_minutes=5)

# Create Teams of Teams architecture
collective = TeamsOfTeamsCollective((21, 21, 21))
collective.activate()
collective.process()
```

## Practical Applications

Several ready-to-use applications in the `examples/` directory demonstrate practical uses of CascadeOS:

1. **Meditation Enhancer**: Enhance meditation with real-time phi-harmonic feedback
2. **Creative Flow Enhancer**: Boost creative work with flow state optimization
3. **Team Collaboration Field**: Model and optimize team dynamics
4. **Hardware Integration**: Connect to biofeedback sensors (heart rate, EEG, etc.)
5. **Web Interface**: Browser-based access to CascadeOS

See the `examples/README.md` for details on running these applications.

## Core Sacred Constants

```
PHI = 1.618033988749895  # Golden ratio
LAMBDA = 0.618033988749895  # Divine complement (1/PHI)
PHI_PHI = PHI ** PHI  # Hyperdimensional constant
```

## Sacred Frequencies

| Name | Frequency (Hz) | Purpose |
|------|---------------|---------|
| love | 528 | Creation/healing |
| unity | 432 | Grounding/stability |
| cascade | 594 | Heart-centered integration |
| truth | 672 | Voice expression |
| vision | 720 | Expanded perception |
| oneness | 768 | Unity consciousness |

## Running Legacy Cascade Components

For users who want to run the original Cascade system components:

```bash
cd /mnt/d/projects/python/quantum_collaborative
python run_cascade.py --mode full
```

Available modes:
```
--mode simplified  # Run simplified CASCADE demonstration
--mode full        # Run full CASCADE system with proper component imports 
--mode network     # Run network visualization system
```

Additional options:
```
--duration 30      # Simulation duration in seconds
--interactive      # Run in interactive mode with manual progression
--no-visualization # Disable visualizations
```
