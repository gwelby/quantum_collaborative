"""
Toroidal Field Dynamics System

Implementation of quantum field systems based on toroidal energy flow principles,
enabling balanced input/output cycles, perfect field coherence through continuous flow,
self-sustaining energy patterns, and natural phi-harmonic resonance within the torus structure.
